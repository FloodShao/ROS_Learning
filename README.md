## ee3305_pid_control
This folder contains the source code for pid control coded by Guoliang.
Dr. Andi, please refer to this folder. Other folder may not relevant to pid_control task.

To run the code:

1. Download the source code to your `source_dir`.
2. Link the `source_dir` or copy the source folder to your `catkin_ws/src`
3. Install the package husky simulator, as I mentioned in the pdf. Using cmd `sudo apt-get install ros-<distro>-husky-simulator`, and remember to replace the <distro> to your ros version. i.e. if you are using kinetic, replace <distro> with kinetic.
4. The rest should be the same. Build the package, and using `roslaunch` to launch the environment and the node generated. The launch file is in the launch folder.
